# Audio Files

## Sound Effects (/sfx/)
Place short sound effect files here:
- Combat sounds (sword swing, hit, magic cast)
- UI sounds (button click, menu open)
- Pickup sounds (coin, potion, item)
- Footsteps
- Ambient sounds

## Music (/music/)
Place background music tracks here:
- Menu music
- Exploration themes
- Combat/boss themes
- Victory/defeat music

## Recommended formats:
- OGG Vorbis (best for Godot, small file size)
- WAV (uncompressed, good for short SFX)
- MP3 (widely compatible)

## Tips:
- Keep SFX short and punchy
- Loop music tracks seamlessly
- Consider volume normalization
